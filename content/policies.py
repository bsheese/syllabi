    'Diversity':
        '''Our mission statement includes, "The University through our policies, programs and practices is committed 
        to diversity [...]" Our school and this course are made stronger by the mix of people that come into it 
        bringing a diversity of ideas, experiences, and backgrounds. Dimensions of diversity can include sex, race, 
        age, national origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and physical ability, 
        sexual orientation, income, faith and non-faith perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, 
        education, primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style, and communication style. We 
        will strive to establish and maintain a classroom environment that respects and honors the diversity of our 
        students and faculty members. If you have concerns about the class environment, I encourage you to contact 
        me. If you are not comfortable contacting me, you may also bring concerns to the Provost or the Office of 
        Diversity and Inclusion.''',

    'Accommodations':
        '''Illinois Wesleyan University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you 
        anticipate or experience academic barriers based on a disability (including mental health and chronic or 
        temporary medical conditions), it is your responsibility to register with Disability Services. Please note 
        that accommodations are not retroactive and accommodations cannot be provided until I receive an email from 
        Disability Services.  Once the email is sent, please make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss 
        your accommodations confidentially so they may be implemented in a timely fashion.  For more information 
        contact Disability Services by visiting 110 Holmes Hall, or calling 309-556-3231.''',

    'Community of Care':
        '''Mental health and physical health are key components of student wellness, and IWU faculty and staff 
        recognize our role in providing an academically rigorous environment that supports wellness while also 
        providing resources. As a campus community it is important for us to establish mental and physical health 
        promotion practices, destigmatize mental health challenges, normalize care seeking, and provide access to 
        qualified, licensed practitioners that can assist in early identification of and assistance with mental 
        health challenges, whether acute or chronic. We recognize that we live in an ever-changing world that has 
        caused more stress on college students than ever before. Information about Arnold Health Services and 
        Counseling Consultation Services can be found <a href= "https://www.iwu.edu/counseling/">here</a>. Additional 
        mental health resources can be found on the <a href="https://www.iwu.edu/counseling/">IWU Counseling and 
        Consultation Services</a> website.''',

    'Health & Safety':
        'Students are expected to adhere to the Titans Caring for Titans Pledge and act as an advocate for a safe '
        'learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff.',

    'Extended Illness':
        '''Student’s with an illness that requires more than three absences should contact me as soon as possible to 
        discuss options. Class participation is a critical component of the class and cannot be made up through other 
        activities.''',

    'Academic Integrity':
        '''Do not cheat. Do not plagiarize. Do not pay others to do your work. Do not submit others work you found on 
        the internet. Do not use any form of A.I. assistance to complete your work, unless explicitly given 
        permission by the instructor. The University’s rules and regulations regarding <a href = 
        "https://www.iwu.edu/judicial/handbook/StudentHandbookPolicies.html#Cheating">cheating and plagiarism are 
        available in the IWU Student Handbook.</a>''',

    'Working with Others; Attributions for Others’ Work':
        '''The following was adapted from Mark Liffiton’s syllabi language. 
        <li>In general, you may discuss 
        assignments with other people and help each other out by reviewing writing or code for each other, 
        but anything you turn in for a grade needs to reflect your own understanding. For any assignment where you 
        receive assistance from another student, you should email the teaching assistant and provide a brief 
        statement indicating what help you received, if any, and from whom you received it. Simply copying work and 
        giving away solutions are not allowed. </li>
        
        <li> Try to follow this rule of thumb: No matter what help you 
        receive figuring out the concepts involved, when you turn something in you should be able to reproduce the 
        whole thing, working through the assignment again, without any outside help. If you can't, you will have 
        trouble on quizzes, later assignments, etc. </li>
        
        <li> When working on code, it is common to find solutions to 
        small problems you have on sites like StackOverflow, technical blogs, or Github. You may use code you find in 
        these situations provided that both 1) it is only a small snippet, up to maybe ten lines of code long, 
        and 2) you clearly and accurately cite the source of the code you are using in a comment nearby. Explain 
        where you found it (with a URL) and what problem it is solving for you. And for your own sake, make sure you 
        understand it. Some assignments may have more specific rules than these about what collaboration or re-use is 
        allowed. </li>''',

    'Changes to Syllabus':
        'I reserve the right to alter any part of the syllabus or course schedule at any time. '
        'Changes will be announced in class or through email.',

    'End-of-Syllabus Advice':
        '''Come to office hours. Previous students say coming to office hours helped them with the hard parts of 
        learning how to program. If something in class or in the book isn't clear, the one-on-one interaction with an 
        instructor or TA is often the best way to work it out. Office hours are an important extension of the class 
        sessions, which won't always be sufficient by themselves. In general, the more we interact, and not just in 
        the classroom, the better the semester will be. '''

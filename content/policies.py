    'Participation':
        '''Each student benefits from the engagement of all others in the class. Attending every class period on time 
       and prepared is the base level expected of everyone. 
       <li>Positive Engagement: Positive engagement with the class is expected from every student. 
       Positive engagement involves constructive participation, 
       in class or out, such as asking questions, answering them, sharing insights or useful/interesting resources 
       with the class, investigating concepts beyond the requirement in class, working on small independent 
       learning projects, etc. 
       <li>Negative Engagement: Negative engagement with the class undermines learning for individual students and for the 
       class collectively. Negative engagement includes, but it not limited to, disrupting class (e.g., regularly showing up late,
       regularly leaving class), dominating the conversation, coming to class unprepared or unwilling to participate in class or
       group activites, and being disrespectful of peers.

        '''Mental health and physical health are key components of student wellness, and IWU faculty and staff 
        recognize our role in providing an academically rigorous environment that supports wellness while also

        qualified, licensed practitioners that can assist in early identification of and assistance with mental 
        health challenges, whether acute or chronic. We recognize that we live in an ever-changing world that has

    'Academic Integrity':
        '''Do not cheat. Do not plagiarize. Do not pay others to do your work. Do not submit others work you found on

        permission by the instructor. The University’s rules and regulations regarding <a href =

        available in the IWU Student Handbook.</a>''',

    'Working with Others; Attributions for Others’ Work':
        '''The following was adapted from Mark Liffiton’s syllabi language. 
        <li>In general, you may discuss 
        assignments with other people and help each other out by reviewing writing or code for each other, 
        but anything you turn in for a grade needs to reflect your own understanding. For any assignment where you 
        receive assistance from another student, you should email the teaching assistant and provide a brief 
        statement indicating what help you received, if any, and from whom you received it. Simply copying work and 
        giving away solutions are not allowed. </li>
        
        <li> Try to follow this rule of thumb: No matter what help you 
        receive figuring out the concepts involved, when you turn something in you should be able to reproduce the 
        whole thing, working through the assignment again, without any outside help. If you can't, you will have 
        trouble on quizzes, later assignments, etc. </li>
        
        <li> When working on code, it is common to find solutions to 
        small problems you have on sites like StackOverflow, technical blogs, or Github. You may use code you find in 
        these situations provided that both 1) it is only a small snippet, up to maybe ten lines of code long, 
        and 2) you clearly and accurately cite the source of the code you are using in a comment nearby. Explain 
        where you found it (with a URL) and what problem it is solving for you. And for your own sake, make sure you 
        understand it. Some assignments may have more specific rules than these about what collaboration or re-use is 
        allowed. </li>''',

    'Changes to Syllabus':
        'I reserve the right to alter any part of the syllabus or course schedule at any time. '
        'Changes will be announced in class or through email.',

    'End-of-Syllabus Advice':
        '''Come to office hours. Previous students say coming to office hours helped them with the hard parts of 
        learning how to program. If something in class or in the book isn't clear, the one-on-one interaction with an 
        instructor or TA is often the best way to work it out. Office hours are an important extension of the class 
        sessions, which won't always be sufficient by themselves. In general, the more we interact, and not just in 
        the classroom, the better the semester will be. '''

             '''<p>This course serves as an introduction to computer science (CS) and data science (DS). 
         In it, you will learn about both as fields of study and work, you will learn computer programming as a 
         fundamental skill (or an art, many would say) applied in both, and you will learn the basics of applying 
         that skill to problems of data exploration and analysis. We will start by answering the questions "What is 
         computer science?", "What are computers?", "What is data science?", and, most importantly, "How can we solve 
         problems with them?"</p>
         <p>Programming is a fundamental part of CS and DS, and we will spend a great deal 
         of time learning how to program. We'll start with a simple one-line program and work towards incorporating 
         many of the tools and techniques that allow people to create complex, valuable code like operating systems, 
         video games, and search engines (but we won't quite be ready to make those, yet). We will apply programming 
         to learning about and answering questions about data, which are some of the core activities of data science. 
         And we will be programming using the Python language in notebooks, one of the most common programming 
         environments for practicing data scientists today.</p>
         <p>Upon completing this course, you will have a good 
         understanding of what CS and DS are, including the diverse branches of study and practice contained within 
         both; you will be comfortable working in a notebook programming environment; you will understand the 
         fundamental concepts and constructs of programming; and you will be able to complete simple projects 
         following a standard data science workflow. Overall, you will be able to write programs that make a computer 
         do what you want it to do, giving you a much greater degree of control over it than you had previously, 
         and you will know how to apply that skill to processing and learning from data. Of course, you will also be 
         well prepared to continue on to other courses in computer science, in data science, or in other areas that 
         involve programming.</p> '''

             '''Developing software is the primary application of computer science. Very often, a good answer to the central question of computer science, "What can we do with computers?" is "We can do this," where 'this' is a software application that solves a problem or meets some need. With the CS I and CS II courses serving as introductions to computer science and its central tool, programming, this course serves as an introduction to the practice of software development, which is the application of programming to produce a complete, useful piece of software.
                This course covers everything in that process from initially gathering requirements to delivering a final, working product and everything in between. We will learn about and practice effective processes and techniques used in software development and gain experience using development tools and methodologies for group work that make the process easier. The course culminates with a team project in which you will apply all of the above to create a software application much larger than anything else you have probably tackled until now.
                As a writing-intensive course, we will spend a significant amount of time focusing on writing, and specifically writing about technical subjects in our field. We will "focus on writing as a process, with opportunities for revision" over several assignments to work on each student's writing and communication skills individually.
                Upon completing this course, you will have gained the ability to conceive, plan, implement, test, debug, and document a complete software application, preparing you for projects in upper-level courses to come. You will be familiar with a wide range of tools that can make you a more effective programmer, and you will have significant experience with the particular set we employ in this class. While you may not always be developing the same type of software with the same language on the same platform, the experience will translate well to using similar tools you encounter in the future.

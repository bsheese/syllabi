         'Course Goals':
             '''<p>This course serves as an introduction to computer science (CS) and data science (DS). 
         In it, you will learn about both as fields of study and work, you will learn computer programming as a 
         fundamental skill (or an art, many would say) applied in both, and you will learn the basics of applying 
         that skill to problems of data exploration and analysis. We will start by answering the questions "What is 
         computer science?", "What are computers?", "What is data science?", and, most importantly, "How can we solve 
         problems with them?"</p>
         <p>Programming is a fundamental part of CS and DS, and we will spend a great deal 
         of time learning how to program. We'll start with a simple one-line program and work towards incorporating 
         many of the tools and techniques that allow people to create complex, valuable code like operating systems, 
         video games, and search engines (but we won't quite be ready to make those, yet). We will apply programming 
         to learning about and answering questions about data, which are some of the core activities of data science. 
         And we will be programming using the Python language in notebooks, one of the most common programming 
         environments for practicing data scientists today.</p>
         <p>Upon completing this course, you will have a good 
         understanding of what CS and DS are, including the diverse branches of study and practice contained within 
         both; you will be comfortable working in a notebook programming environment; you will understand the 
         fundamental concepts and constructs of programming; and you will be able to complete simple projects 
         following a standard data science workflow. Overall, you will be able to write programs that make a computer 
         do what you want it to do, giving you a much greater degree of control over it than you had previously, 
         and you will know how to apply that skill to processing and learning from data. Of course, you will also be 
         well prepared to continue on to other courses in computer science, in data science, or in other areas that 
         involve programming.</p> '''

         complex neural network structures to solve a variety of problems, studying their implementation and 
         limitations along the way. We will study several specific deep learning network structures that have been 
         found to perform well in a domains, including convolutional neural networks for computer vision and 
         recurrent neural networks for natural language processing. And along the way, we will study and consider the

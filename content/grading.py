    'Reading Responses':
        '''This class will be taught in a "flipped" style, meaning you will be responsible for your initial exposure 
        to learning new material outside of class, and time in class will be spent on exercises and activities that 
        will strengthen the understanding you bring to class. A set of questions will be assigned to be answered 
        before most classes. These questions will invite your reaction to the assigned material and check your 
        understanding of it. Your responses will help us tailor our time in class to your needs. Answering reading 
        responses before class is critical, and so responses will not be accepted after the assigned deadline. Late 
        or missing reading response submissions receive zero points.''',

    'Exercises and Assignments':
        '''Every week we will have assigned work that students are responsible for completing independently. 
        Exercises and assignments are designed to refine and expand your understanding of the course material 
        and are essential for success in the class. Exercises will be posted on Moodle and are due at set times as 
        indicated on Moodle. <br><p>
        
        Please note the following: 
        <li>Note book submission must be free from errors and run properly. Students should selected 'Restart and run 
        all' prior to submission to verify that everything is working. Notebooks with errors will receive zero 
        points.</li> 
        <li>Submissions with missing or broken revision histories will receive zero points.</li> 
        <li>Copy and pasting from other notebooks is prohibited. Exercise submissions with any form of directly copied 
        code receive will zero points.</li>
        <li>AI generated code is prohibited (see course AI policy). Submission of A.I. generated code will result 
        in zero points and a referral for academic dishonesty.</li> 
        <li>Late or missing exercise submissions receive zero points. Students should be submitting work well in 
        advance of the deadline.</li>
        <li>Assignments will get longer and more complicated as the semester progresses because we have more coding
        tools to use to solve problems.</li> 
        <li>Assignments are graded for completeness and correctness. To earn credit, your assignment must be fully
         complete and correct.</li> 
        <li>The questions in each assignment/exercise typically build up to the final question.
         You need to reach the final questions and complete it to receive credit.</li> 
        <li>We are happy to provide some pointers/suggestions as you work on your assignment. But, we are not 
        going to give you the answers or do the work for you.  Please make effective use of our office hours 
        and class time.</li>   
        <li>Successful students will often have the week's work done before Friday so they can get 
        help they need along the way.</li>

    'Quizzes and Exams':
        '''Quizzes and exams will cover all material until that point in the semester, but will primarily focus on 
        material since the previous assessments. Missed quizzes and exams will receive zero points unless prior approval 
        has been received from the instructor.''',

    'Projects/Presentations':
        '''Any required projects or presentations will be announced in class and detailed information 
        will be provided on Moodle.''',

    'CodeHelp Usage':
        '''At the end of the semester students will be graded on the quantity and quality of CodeHelp submissions.
        Students are expected to submit a minimum of 40 queries during the course of the semester. To be counted as 
        a distinct query, queries must not duplicate previous queries (asking the same question again does not count 
        as a new query), must be relevant to the class, and must show evidence of the student progressing through course 
         related problems.''',

    'Grade for the Course':
        '''Course grades will be calculated at the end of the term by dividing the points earned by the total number of 
        available points. Grading details are available on Moodle.''',

    'Regrading':
        '''If you would like to request a regrade, submit a request to the instructor via email within one week of

        and why.''',

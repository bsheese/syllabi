    'Reading Responses':
        '''This class will be taught in a "flipped" style, meaning you will be responsible for your initial exposure 
        to learning new material outside of class, and time in class will be spent on exercises and activities that 
        will strengthen the understanding you bring to class. A set of questions will be assigned to be answered 
        before most classes. These questions will invite your reaction to the assigned material and check your 
        understanding of it. Your responses will help us tailor our time in class to your needs. Answering reading 
        responses before class is critical, and so responses will not be accepted after the assigned deadline. Late 
        or missing reading response submissions receive zero points.''',

    'Exercises':
        '''Every week we will have assigned exercises that students are responsible for completing independently 
        during this time. These exercises are designed to refine and expand your understanding of the course material 
        and are essential for success in the class. Exercises will be posted on Moodle and aredue at set times as 
        indicated on Moodle. Exercise submissions with missing or broken revision histories will receive zero points. 
        Copy and pasting from others notebooks is prohibited. Exercise submissions with any form of directly copied 
        code receive will zero points. Late or missing exercise submissions receive zero points.''',

    'Quizzes and Exams':
        '''Quizzes and exams will cover all material until that point in the semester, but will primarily focus on 
        material since the previous assessments. Missed quizzes and exams will receive zero points unless prior approval 
        has been received from the instructor.''',

    'Projects/Presentations':
        'Detailed information about projects/presentations can be found on Moodle.',

    'Class Attendance':
        '''Class time is complementary to the reading, and you will need both in order to learn all of the material 
        in this class.''',

    'Class Absence':
        'Students are responsible for any work missed due to absences. Work may almost always be submitted early. It '
        'may not be submitted late.',

    'Class Participation':
        'Each student benefits from the engagement of all others in the class. Attending every class period on time '
        'and prepared is the base level expected of everyone. Higher engagement involves constructive participation, '
        'in class or out, such as asking questions, answering them, sharing insights or useful/interesting resources '
        'with the class, investigating concepts beyond the requirement in class, working on small independent '
        'learning projects, etc. Students with excessive (more than 3) unexcused absences, disrupting class (e.g., '
        'regularly showing up late), dominating the conversation, and other detrimental actions may have their final '
        'course grade reduced by up to a full letter grade.''',

    'Grade for the Course':
        'Course grades will be calculated at the end of the term by dividing the points earned by the total number of '
        'available points. Grading details are available on Moodle.',

    'Regrading':
        'If you would like to request a regrade, submit a request to the instructor via email within one week of '
        'receiving the graded exercise, exam, etc. Indicate exactly which part you believe deserves a different score '
        'and why.',

    'Late Work Policy':
        'Unless otherwise stated, late work of any kind will not receive credit.'

    'Reading Responses':
        '''This class will be taught in a "flipped" style, meaning you will be responsible for your initial exposure 
        to learning new material outside of class, and time in class will be spent on exercises and activities that 
        will strengthen the understanding you bring to class. A set of questions will be assigned to be answered 
        before most classes. These questions will invite your reaction to the assigned material and check your 
        understanding of it. Your responses will help us tailor our time in class to your needs. Answering reading 
        responses before class is critical, and so responses will not be accepted after the assigned deadline. Late 
        or missing reading response submissions receive zero points.''',

    'Exercises':
        '''Every week we will have assigned exercises that students are responsible for completing independently 
        during this time. These exercises are designed to refine and expand your understanding of the course material 
        and are essential for success in the class. Exercises will be posted on Moodle and aredue at set times as 
        indicated on Moodle. Exercise submissions with missing or broken revision histories will receive zero points. 
        Copy and pasting from others notebooks is prohibited. Exercise submissions with any form of directly copied 
        code receive will zero points. Late or missing exercise submissions receive zero points.''',

    'Quizzes and Exams':
        '''Quizzes and exams will cover all material until that point in the semester, but will primarily focus on 
        material since the previous assessments. Missed quizzes and exams will receive zero points unless prior approval 
        has been received from the instructor.''',

    'Projects/Presentations':
        'Detailed information about projects/presentations can be found on Moodle.',
    
    'Final Exam Period':
        'Class will meet during the scheduled final exam period. All students are expected to attend in person during the Fall and Spring semester classes.',

    'Attendance / Absences / Late to Class / Participation':
         '''Each student benefits from the engagement of all others in the class. Attending every class period on time 
        and prepared is the base level expected of everyone. 
        <li>Positive Engagement: Positive engagement with the class is expected from every student. 
        Positive engagement involves constructive participation, 
        in class or out, such as asking questions, answering them, sharing insights or useful/interesting resources 
        with the class, investigating concepts beyond the requirement in class, working on small independent 
        learning projects, etc. 
        <li>Negative Engagement: Negative engagement with the class undermines learning for individual students and for the 
        class collectively. Negative engagement includes, but it not limited to, disrupting class (e.g., regularly showing up late,
        regularly leaving class), dominating the conversation, coming to class unprepared or unwilling to participate in class or
        group activites, and being disrespectful of peers.
        <li>Grace Tokens: Students have three grace tokens to excuse absences for any reason. The primary purpose of
        these tokens is to cover instances where absences are required due to illness, personal emergencies, or professional
        development opportunities (e.g., job or internships interviews).   
        <li>Required Attendance: Class time is complementary to the reading, and you will need both in order to learn all of the material 
        in this class. Class attendance is required. Students with unexcused absences will lose a grace token.
        <li>Late to Class: Coming late to class consistently is disruptive to the class and undermines student learning. 
        Students are expected to be in class prior to the beginning of the scheduled class time. For virtual classes, students
        are expected to have their video and audio up and running prior to the beginning of class. Students who are late 
        for any reason will lose a grace token.
        <li>University Sponsored Events: Students attending University-sponsored events will be excused
        but must be able to provide documentation if requested.
        <li>Illness: Students who are ill should not come to class. Grace tokens will be used to cover absences due
        to illness and should be reserved for this use.
        <li>Missed Work: "Students are responsible for completing all missed assignments and reading due to absences.
        Work may almost always be submitted early, but it may not be submitted late.
        <li>Penalties: After exhausting their grace tokens, students will receive a deduction from the final course total for every
        instance of a violation of course policies/requirements. Deductions will start at 1% of the final course grade.
        ''',

    'Grade for the Course':
        '''Course grades will be calculated at the end of the term by dividing the points earned by the total number of 
        available points. Grading details are available on Moodle.''',

    'Regrading':
        '''If you would like to request a regrade, submit a request to the instructor via email within one week of 
        receiving the graded exercise, exam, etc. Indicate exactly which part you believe deserves a different score 
        and why.''',

    'Late Work Policy':
        'Unless otherwise stated, late work of any kind will not receive credit.'

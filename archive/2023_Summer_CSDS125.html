            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            Computer science, broadly, studies how to solve problems using computers.  Data 
         science is a related field that focuses on acquiring, cleaning, and exploring data, via visualization and 
         statistical analysis, to aid decision making. This course introduces the fundamental skill of computer 
         science, programming, using data science examples and applications.  No prerequisites.

            <h2>Course Goals</h2>
            <p>This course serves as an introduction to computer science (CS) and data science (DS). 
         In it, you will learn about both as fields of study and work, you will learn computer programming as a 
         fundamental skill (or an art, many would say) applied in both, and you will learn the basics of applying 
         that skill to problems of data exploration and analysis. We will start by answering the questions "What is 
         computer science?", "What are computers?", "What is data science?", and, most importantly, "How can we solve 
         problems with them?"</p>
         <p>Programming is a fundamental part of CS and DS, and we will spend a great deal 
         of time learning how to program. We'll start with a simple one-line program and work towards incorporating 
         many of the tools and techniques that allow people to create complex, valuable code like operating systems, 
         video games, and search engines (but we won't quite be ready to make those, yet). We will apply programming 
         to learning about and answering questions about data, which are some of the core activities of data science. 
         And we will be programming using the Python language in notebooks, one of the most common programming 
         environments for practicing data scientists today.</p>
         <p>Upon completing this course, you will have a good 
         understanding of what CS and DS are, including the diverse branches of study and practice contained within 
         both; you will be comfortable working in a notebook programming environment; you will understand the 
         fundamental concepts and constructs of programming; and you will be able to complete simple projects 
         following a standard data science workflow. Overall, you will be able to write programs that make a computer 
         do what you want it to do, giving you a much greater degree of control over it than you had previously, 
         and you will know how to apply that skill to processing and learning from data. Of course, you will also be 
         well prepared to continue on to other courses in computer science, in data science, or in other areas that 
         involve programming.</p>

      <h1>Course Work and Grading</h1>

      
        
          
            <h2>Work Load</h2>
            This is a 4 credit hour course which carries the expectation of 10-12 hours per week during a 
        regular semester (3 hours in class, 8-9 hours of work outside class). In a seven week summer session the 
        expectation is 20-24 hours per week (6 hours in class, 16-18 hours of work outside of class).</p> 

        <h3>Regular Session, Fifteen Weeks:</h3>
        <li>Synchronous instruction: 3 hours per week,  45 hours total</li>
        <li>Daily assigned reading and reading responses: 2 hours per week, 30 hours total</li>
        <li>Weekly assignments: 3 hours per week, 45 hours total</li>
        <li>Projects, project presentations, peer assessment: 12 hours total</li>
        <li>Overall Assigned Workload (excludes studying for assessments): 132 hours total (7920 minutes)</li>
        
        <h3>Summer Session, Seven Weeks:</h3>
        <li>Synchronous instruction: 5 hours per week, 35 hours total</li>
        <li>Daily assigned reading and reading responses: 4 hours per week, 28 hours total</li>
        <li>Weekly assignments: 6 hours per week, 42 hours total
        <li>Projects, project presentations, peer assessment: 12 hours total</li>
        <li>Overall Assigned Workload (excludes studying for assessments): 117 hours total (7020 minutes)</li>
          
        
          
            <h2>Reading Responses</h2>
            This class will be taught in a "flipped" style, meaning you will be responsible for your initial exposure 
        to learning new material outside of class, and time in class will be spent on exercises and activities that 
        will strengthen the understanding you bring to class. A set of questions will be assigned to be answered 
        before most classes. These questions will invite your reaction to the assigned material and check your 
        understanding of it. Your responses will help us tailor our time in class to your needs. Answering reading 
        responses before class is critical, and so responses will not be accepted after the assigned deadline. Late 
        or missing reading response submissions receive zero points.
          
        
          
            <h2>Exercises</h2>
            Every week we will have assigned exercises that students are responsible for completing independently 
        during this time. These exercises are designed to refine and expand your understanding of the course material 
        and are essential for success in the class. Exercises will be posted on Moodle and aredue at set times as 
        indicated on Moodle. Exercise submissions with missing or broken revision histories will receive zero points. 
        Copy and pasting from others notebooks is prohibited. Exercise submissions with any form of directly copied 
        code receive will zero points. Late or missing exercise submissions receive zero points.
          
        
          
            <h2>Quizzes and Exams</h2>
            Quizzes and exams will cover all material until that point in the semester, but will primarily focus on 
        material since the previous assessments. Missed quizzes and exams will receive zero points unless prior approval 
        has been received from the instructor.
          
        
          
            <h2>Projects/Presentations</h2>
            Detailed information about projects/presentations can be found on Moodle.
          
        
          
            <h2>Class Attendance</h2>
            Class time is complementary to the reading, and you will need both in order to learn all of the material 
        in this class.
          
        
          
            <h2>Class Absence</h2>
            Students are responsible for any work missed due to absences. Work may almost always be submitted early. It may not be submitted late.
          
        
          
            <h2>Class Participation</h2>
            Each student benefits from the engagement of all others in the class. Attending every class period on time and prepared is the base level expected of everyone. Higher engagement involves constructive participation, in class or out, such as asking questions, answering them, sharing insights or useful/interesting resources with the class, investigating concepts beyond the requirement in class, working on small independent learning projects, etc. Students with excessive (more than 3) unexcused absences, disrupting class (e.g., regularly showing up late), dominating the conversation, and other detrimental actions may have their final course grade reduced by up to a full letter grade.
          
        
          
            <h2>Grade for the Course</h2>
            Course grades will be calculated at the end of the term by dividing the points earned by the total number of available points. Grading details are available on Moodle.
          
        
          
            <h2>Regrading</h2>
            If you would like to request a regrade, submit a request to the instructor via email within one week of receiving the graded exercise, exam, etc. Indicate exactly which part you believe deserves a different score and why.
          
        
          
            <h2>Late Work Policy</h2>
            Unless otherwise stated, late work of any kind will not receive credit.

      <h1>Course Policies</h1>

      
        
          
            <h2>Diversity</h2>
            Our mission statement includes, "The University through our policies, programs and practices is committed 
        to diversity [...]" Our school and this course are made stronger by the mix of people that come into it 
        bringing a diversity of ideas, experiences, and backgrounds. Dimensions of diversity can include sex, race, 
        age, national origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and physical ability, 
        sexual orientation, income, faith and non-faith perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, 
        education, primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style, and communication style. We 
        will strive to establish and maintain a classroom environment that respects and honors the diversity of our 
        students and faculty members. If you have concerns about the class environment, I encourage you to contact 
        me. If you are not comfortable contacting me, you may also bring concerns to the Provost or the Office of 
        Diversity and Inclusion.
          
        
          
            <h2>Accommodations</h2>
            Illinois Wesleyan University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you 
        anticipate or experience academic barriers based on a disability (including mental health and chronic or 
        temporary medical conditions), it is your responsibility to register with Disability Services. Please note 
        that accommodations are not retroactive and accommodations cannot be provided until I receive an email from 
        Disability Services.  Once the email is sent, please make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss 
        your accommodations confidentially so they may be implemented in a timely fashion.  For more information 
        contact Disability Services by visiting 110 Holmes Hall, or calling 309-556-3231.
          
        
          
            <h2>Community of Care</h2>
            Mental health and physical health are key components of student wellness, and IWU faculty and staff 
        recognize our role in providing an academically rigorous environment that supports wellness while also 
        providing resources. As a campus community it is important for us to establish mental and physical health 
        promotion practices, destigmatize mental health challenges, normalize care seeking, and provide access to 
        qualified, licensed practitioners that can assist in early identification of and assistance with mental 
        health challenges, whether acute or chronic. We recognize that we live in an ever-changing world that has 
        caused more stress on college students than ever before. Information about Arnold Health Services and 
        Counseling Consultation Services can be found <a href= "https://www.iwu.edu/counseling/">here</a>. Additional 
        mental health resources can be found on the <a href="https://www.iwu.edu/counseling/">IWU Counseling and 
        Consultation Services</a> website.
          
        
          
            <h2>Health & Safety</h2>
            Students are expected to adhere to the Titans Caring for Titans Pledge and act as an advocate for a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff.
          
        
          
            <h2>Extended Illness</h2>
            Student’s with an illness that requires more than three absences should contact me as soon as possible to 
        discuss options. Class participation is a critical component of the class and cannot be made up through other 
        activities.
          
        
          
            <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
            Do not cheat. Do not plagiarize. Do not pay others to do your work. Do not submit others work you found on 
        the internet. Do not use any form of A.I. assistance to complete your work, unless explicitly given 
        permission by the instructor. The University’s rules and regulations regarding <a href = 
        "https://www.iwu.edu/judicial/handbook/StudentHandbookPolicies.html#Cheating">cheating and plagiarism are 
        available in the IWU Student Handbook.</a>
          
        
          
            <h2>Working with Others; Attributions for Others’ Work</h2>
            The following was adapted from Mark Liffiton’s syllabi language. 
        <li>In general, you may discuss 
        assignments with other people and help each other out by reviewing writing or code for each other, 
        but anything you turn in for a grade needs to reflect your own understanding. For any assignment where you 
        receive assistance from another student, you should email the teaching assistant and provide a brief 
        statement indicating what help you received, if any, and from whom you received it. Simply copying work and 
        giving away solutions are not allowed. </li>
        
        <li> Try to follow this rule of thumb: No matter what help you 
        receive figuring out the concepts involved, when you turn something in you should be able to reproduce the 
        whole thing, working through the assignment again, without any outside help. If you can't, you will have 
        trouble on quizzes, later assignments, etc. </li>
        
        <li> When working on code, it is common to find solutions to 
        small problems you have on sites like StackOverflow, technical blogs, or Github. You may use code you find in 
        these situations provided that both 1) it is only a small snippet, up to maybe ten lines of code long, 
        and 2) you clearly and accurately cite the source of the code you are using in a comment nearby. Explain 
        where you found it (with a URL) and what problem it is solving for you. And for your own sake, make sure you 
        understand it. Some assignments may have more specific rules than these about what collaboration or re-use is 
        allowed. </li>
          
        
          
            <h2>Changes to Syllabus</h2>
            I reserve the right to alter any part of the syllabus or course schedule at any time. Changes will be announced in class or through email.
          
        
          
            <h2>End-of-Syllabus Advice</h2>
            Come to office hours. Previous students say coming to office hours helped them with the hard parts of 
        learning how to program. If something in class or in the book isn't clear, the one-on-one interaction with an 
        instructor or TA is often the best way to work it out. Office hours are an important extension of the class 
        sessions, which won't always be sufficient by themselves. In general, the more we interact, and not just in 
        the classroom, the better the semester will be.

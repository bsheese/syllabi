            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            This is a course that builds on CS/DS 125 and Statistics to develop intermediate and advanced data 
             analytic skills. In particular, this course introduces advanced concepts and tools relevant to data
             cleaning, organization, and transformation. It further develops skills and knowledge about identifying
             and applying appropriate statistical tools to answer data-driven questions. It provides advanced
             treatment of the ethical issues involved in data analytic work. It also teaches students the use
             of specific software commonly used in data analytics, such as databases for storing and retrieving
             data and business intelligence software for creating reports from analysis results.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Course Text</h2>
            There is no textbook for the class. Assigned readings are available through moodle.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Course Tools</h2>
            This course makes heavy use of Moodle. Students are expected to keep up to date with Moodle throughout the semester.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Course Topics/Skills</h2>
                     
                The core topics addressed by this course are:
                
                <li>Algorithmic / computational thinking</li>
                <li>Communication (written and verbal)</li>
                <li>Data curation / management</li>
                <li>Ethics (privacy, informed consent, data security)</li>
                <li>Statistics / statistical inference</li>
                <li>Visualization</li>
                <br>
                Specific skills developed through this course include:<br>
                
                <li>data preparation skills using coding, including data cleaning, organization, and transformation</li>
                <li>statistical analysis including descriptive statistics, exploratory analyses, inferential statistics,
                 and modeling up through simple linear regression</li>
                <li>data aggregation techniques including contingency tables (cross-tabs) and pivot tables</li>
                <li>analysis and visualization for data-informed decision making</li>
                <li>use of business intelligence software (e.g. Power BI)</li>
                <li>use of databases for retrieving data (database queries)</li>
                <br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Course Goals</h2>
            Data is central to the natural and social sciences, accounting, business, marketing, and economics. 
             As information technology grows in power and ubiquity, the amount of data collected
             is growing commensurately. Data Analytics refers to knowledge and skills associated with exploring,
             analyzing, and visualizing data to aid decision making. Data Analytics is distinct from Data Science, 
             in that there is less emphasis on complex computational approaches to data modeling. It is also distinct 
             from traditional statistics in that, while it includes statistics, it also involves data organization, 
             curation, and visualization. Many of our graduates will move on to careers where they are working with 
             data and would benefit from formal training in Data Analytic techniques.<br><br>

      <h1>Course Work and Grading</h1>

      
        
          
            
          
        
          
            <h2>Reading Responses</h2>
            This class will be taught in a "flipped" style, meaning you will be responsible for your initial exposure 
        to learning new material outside of class, and time in class will be spent on exercises and activities that 
        will strengthen the understanding you bring to class. A set of questions will be assigned to be answered 
        before most classes. These questions will invite your reaction to the assigned material and check your 
        understanding of it. Your responses will help us tailor our time in class to your needs. Answering reading 
        responses before class is critical, and so responses will not be accepted after the assigned deadline. Late 
        or missing reading response submissions receive zero points.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Exercises</h2>
            Every week we will have assigned exercises that students are responsible for completing independently 
        during this time. These exercises are designed to refine and expand your understanding of the course material 
        and are essential for success in the class. Exercises will be posted on Moodle and aredue at set times as 
        indicated on Moodle. Exercise submissions with missing or broken revision histories will receive zero points. 
        Copy and pasting from others notebooks is prohibited. Exercise submissions with any form of directly copied 
        code receive will zero points. Late or missing exercise submissions receive zero points.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Quizzes and Exams</h2>
            Quizzes and exams will cover all material until that point in the semester, but will primarily focus on 
        material since the previous assessments. Missed quizzes and exams will receive zero points unless prior approval 
        has been received from the instructor.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Projects/Presentations</h2>
            Detailed information about projects/presentations can be found on Moodle.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Grade for the Course</h2>
            Course grades will be calculated at the end of the term by dividing the points earned by the total number of 
        available points. Grading details are available on Moodle.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Regrading</h2>
            If you would like to request a regrade, submit a request to the instructor via email within one week of 
        receiving the graded exercise, exam, etc. Indicate exactly which part you believe deserves a different score 
        and why.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Late Work Policy</h2>
            Unless otherwise stated, late work of any kind will not receive credit.<br><br>
          
        

      
      </p><br><br>
    
      <p><hr><hr>
      

      <h1>Course Policies</h1>

      
        
          
            <h2>Final Exam Period</h2>
            Class will meet during the scheduled final exam period. All students are expected to attend in person during Fall and Spring semester classes.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Grace Tokens</h2>
            Students receive three grace tokens at the beginning of the semester. Grace tokens are deducted for absences and being late to class. When <br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Attendance</h2>
            Attendance is required. Non-attendance for any reason besides a University sponsoredevent will result in the loss of a grace token. This includes illness. Please reserve your grace tokens for unforseen events such as illness. Otherwise, planon being in class.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Late to Class</h2>
            Coming late to class consistently is disruptive to the class and undermines student learning. Students are expected to be in class prior to the beginning of the scheduled class time. For virtual classes, students are expected to have their video and audio up and running prior to the beginning of class. Students who are late for any reason will lose a grace token.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>University Sponsored Events</h2>
            Students attending University-sponsored events will be excused but must be able to provide documentation if requested.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Illness</h2>
            Students who are ill should not come to class. Grace tokens will be used to cover absences due to illness and should be reserved for this use.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Missed Work</h2>
            Students are responsible for completing all missed assignments and reading due to absences. Work may almost always be submitted early, but it may not be submitted late.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Penalties</h2>
            After exhausting their grace tokens, students will receive a deduction from the final course total for every instance of a violation of course policies/requirements. Deductions will start at 1% of the final course grade.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Participation</h2>
            Each student benefits from the engagement of all others in the class. Attending every class period on time 
       and prepared is the base level expected of everyone. 
       <li>Positive Engagement: Positive engagement with the class is expected from every student. 
       Positive engagement involves constructive participation, 
       in class or out, such as asking questions, answering them, sharing insights or useful/interesting resources 
       with the class, investigating concepts beyond the requirement in class, working on small independent 
       learning projects, etc. 
       <li>Negative Engagement: Negative engagement with the class undermines learning for individual students and for the 
       class collectively. Negative engagement includes, but it not limited to, disrupting class (e.g., regularly showing up late,
       regularly leaving class), dominating the conversation, coming to class unprepared or unwilling to participate in class or
       group activites, and being disrespectful of peers.
       <br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Diversity</h2>
            Our mission statement includes, "The University through our policies, programs and practices is committed 
        to diversity [...]" Our school and this course are made stronger by the mix of people that come into it 
        bringing a diversity of ideas, experiences, and backgrounds. Dimensions of diversity can include sex, race, 
        age, national origin, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and physical ability, 
        sexual orientation, income, faith and non-faith perspectives, socio-economic class, political ideology, 
        education, primary language, family status, military experience, cognitive style, and communication style. We 
        will strive to establish and maintain a classroom environment that respects and honors the diversity of our 
        students and faculty members. If you have concerns about the class environment, I encourage you to contact 
        me. If you are not comfortable contacting me, you may also bring concerns to the Provost or the Office of 
        Diversity and Inclusion.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Accommodations</h2>
            Illinois Wesleyan University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you 
        anticipate or experience academic barriers based on a disability (including mental health and chronic or 
        temporary medical conditions), it is your responsibility to register with Disability Services. Please note 
        that accommodations are not retroactive and accommodations cannot be provided until I receive an email from 
        Disability Services.  Once the email is sent, please make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss 
        your accommodations confidentially so they may be implemented in a timely fashion.  For more information 
        contact the <a href= "https://www.iwu.edu/accessibility/">Office of Student Accessibility Services</a>.<br>
        <br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Community of Care</h2>
            Mental health and physical health are key components of student wellness, and IWU faculty and staff 
        recognize our role in providing an academically rigorous environment that supports wellness while also 
        providing resources. As a campus community it is important for us to establish mental and physical health 
        promotion practices, destigmatize mental health challenges, normalize care seeking, and provide access to 
        qualified, licensed practitioners that can assist in early identification of and assistance with mental 
        health challenges, whether acute or chronic. We recognize that we live in an ever-changing world that has 
        caused more stress on college students than ever before. Information about Arnold Health Services and 
        Counseling Consultation Services can be found <a href= "https://www.iwu.edu/counseling/">here</a>. Additional 
        mental health resources can be found on the <a href="https://www.iwu.edu/counseling/">IWU Counseling and 
        Consultation Services</a> website.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Health & Safety</h2>
            Students are expected to adhere to the Titans Caring for Titans Pledge and act as an advocate for a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Extended Illness</h2>
            Student’s with an illness that requires more than three absences should contact me as soon as possible to 
        discuss options. Class participation is a critical component of the class and cannot be made up through other 
        activities.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
            Do not cheat. Do not plagiarize. Do not pay others to do your work. Do not submit others work you found on 
        the internet. Do not use any form of A.I. assistance to complete your work, unless explicitly given 
        permission by the instructor. The University’s rules and regulations regarding <a href = 
        "https://www.iwu.edu/judicial/handbook/StudentHandbookPolicies.html#Cheating">cheating and plagiarism are 
        available in the IWU Student Handbook.</a><br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Working with Others; Attributions for Others’ Work</h2>
            The following was adapted from Mark Liffiton’s syllabi language. 
        <li>In general, you may discuss 
        assignments with other people and help each other out by reviewing writing or code for each other, 
        but anything you turn in for a grade needs to reflect your own understanding. For any assignment where you 
        receive assistance from another student, you should email the teaching assistant and provide a brief 
        statement indicating what help you received, if any, and from whom you received it. Simply copying work and 
        giving away solutions are not allowed. </li>
        
        <li> Try to follow this rule of thumb: No matter what help you 
        receive figuring out the concepts involved, when you turn something in you should be able to reproduce the 
        whole thing, working through the assignment again, without any outside help. If you can't, you will have 
        trouble on quizzes, later assignments, etc. </li>
        
        <li> When working on code, it is common to find solutions to 
        small problems you have on sites like StackOverflow, technical blogs, or Github. You may use code you find in 
        these situations provided that both 1) it is only a small snippet, up to maybe ten lines of code long, 
        and 2) you clearly and accurately cite the source of the code you are using in a comment nearby. Explain 
        where you found it (with a URL) and what problem it is solving for you. And for your own sake, make sure you 
        understand it. Some assignments may have more specific rules than these about what collaboration or re-use is 
        allowed. </li><br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>Changes to Syllabus</h2>
            I reserve the right to alter any part of the syllabus or course schedule at any time. Changes will be announced in class or through email.<br><br>
          
        
          
            <h2>End-of-Syllabus Advice</h2>
            Come to office hours. Previous students say coming to office hours helped them with the hard parts of 
        learning how to program. If something in class or in the book isn't clear, the one-on-one interaction with an 
        instructor or TA is often the best way to work it out. Office hours are an important extension of the class 
        sessions, which won't always be sufficient by themselves. In general, the more we interact, and not just in 
        the classroom, the better the semester will be. <br><br>

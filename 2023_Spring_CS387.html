            <h2>Course Goals</h2>
            From Mark Liffiton's course: This class will study deep learning from several perspectives. First, we will learn the mathematical foundations of building and using artificial neural networks and their implementation in software. With that base of understanding, we will build increasingly complex neural network structures to solve a variety of problems, studying their implementation and limitations along the way. We will study several specific deep learning network structures that have been found to perform well in a domains, including convolutional neural networks for computer vision and recurrent neural networks for natural language processing. And along the way, we will study and consider the ethical implications and issues raised by the use of these complex, often inscrutable systems throughout society.

      <h1>Course Work and Grading</h1>
      
      
        
          
            
          
        
          
            <h2>Reading Responses</h2>
            This class will be taught in a "flipped" style, meaning you will be responsible for your initial exposure to learning new material outside of class, and time in class will be spent on exercises and activities that will strengthen the understanding you bring to class.
A set of questions will be assigned to be answered before most classes. These questions will invite your reaction to the assigned material and check your understanding of it. Your responses will help us tailor our time in class to your needs.
Answering reading responses before class is critical, and so responses will not be accepted after the assigned deadline.
Late or missing reading response submissions receive zero points.
          
        
          
            <h2>Exercises</h2>
             Every week we will have assigned exercises that students are responsible for completing independently during this time. These exercises are designed to refine and expand your understanding of the course material and are essential for success in the class. Exercises will be posted on Moodle and aredue at set times as indicated on Moodle.
Exercise submissions with missing or broken revision histories will receive zero points.
Copy and pasting from others notebooks is prohibited. Exercise submissions with any form of directly copied code receive will zero points.
Late or missing exercise submissions receive zero points.
          
        
          
            <h2>Quizzes and Exams</h2>
            Quizzes and exams will cover all material until that point in the semester, but will primarily focus on material since the previous assessments.
Missed quizzes and exams will receive zero points unless prior approval has been received from the instructor.
          
        
          
            <h2>Projects/Presentations</h2>
            Detailed information about projects/presentations can be found on Moodle.
          
        
          
            <h2>Class Attendance</h2>
            Class time is complementary to the reading, and you will need both in order to learn all of the material in this class.
          
        
          
            <h2>Class Absence</h2>
            Students are responsible for any work missed due to absences. Work may almost always be submitted early. It may not be submitted late.
          
        
          
            <h2>Class Participation</h2>
            Each student benefits from the engagement of all others in the class. Attending every class period on time and prepared is the base level expected of everyone. Higher engagement involves constructive participation, in class or out, such as asking questions, answering them, sharing insights or useful/interesting resources with the class, investigating concepts beyond the requirement in class, working on small independent learning projects, etc. Students with excessive (more than 3) unexcused absences, disrupting class (e.g., regularly showing up late), dominating the conversation, and other detrimental actions may have their final course grade reduced by up to a full letter grade.
          
        
          
            <h2>Grade for the Course</h2>
            Course grades will be calculated at the end of the term by dividing the points earned by the total number of available points. Grading details are available on Moodle.
          
        
          
            <h2>Regrading</h2>
            If you would like to request a regrade, submit a request to the instructor via email within one week of receiving the graded exercise, exam, etc. Indicate exactly which part you believe deserves a different score and why.
          
        
          
            <h2>Late Work Policy</h2>
            Unless otherwise stated, late work of any kind will not receive credit.

            <h2>Community of Care</h2>
            Mental health and physical health are key components of student wellness, and IWU faculty and staff recognize
our role in providing an academically rigorous environment that supports wellness while also providing resources.
As a campus community it is important for us to establish mental and physical health promotion practices,
destigmatize mental health challenges, normalize care seeking, and provide access to qualified, licensed
practitioners that can assist in early identification of and assistance with mental health challenges, whether acute
or chronic. We recognize that we live in an ever-changing world that has caused more stress on college students
than ever before. Information about Arnold Health Services and Counseling Consultation Services can be found <a href=

Services</a> website.
          
        
          
            <h2>Health & Safety</h2>
            Students are expected to adhere to the Titans Caring for Titans Pledge and act as an advocate for a safe learning environment for all students, faculty, and staff.
          
        
          
            <h2>Extended Illness</h2>
            Student’s with an illness that requires more than three absences should contact me as soon as possible to discuss options. Class participation is a critical component of the class and cannot be made up through other activities.
          
        
          
            <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
            Do not cheat. Do not plagiarize. Do not pay others to do your work. Do not submit others work you found on the internet. Do not use any form of A.I. assistance to complete your work, unless explicitly given permission by the instructor. The University’s rules and regulations regarding <a href = "https://www.iwu.edu/judicial/handbook/StudentHandbookPolicies.html#Cheating">cheating and plagiarism are available in the IWU Student Handbook.</a>
          
        
          
            <h2>Working with Others; Attributions for Others’ Work</h2>
            The following was adapted from Mark Liffiton’s syllabi language.
<li>
In general, you may discuss assignments with other people and help each other out by reviewing writing or code for each other, but anything you turn in for a grade needs to reflect your own understanding. For any assignment where you receive assistance from another student, you should email the teaching assistant and provide a brief statement indicating what help you received, if any, and from whom you received it. Simply copying work and giving away solutions are not allowed.
</li><li>
Try to follow this rule of thumb: No matter what help you receive figuring out the concepts involved, when you turn something in you should be able to reproduce the whole thing, working through the assignment again, without any outside help. If you can't, you will have trouble on quizzes, later assignments, etc.
</li><li>
When working on code, it is common to find solutions to small problems you have on sites like StackOverflow, technical blogs, or Github. You may use code you find in these situations provided that both 1) it is only a small snippet, up to maybe ten lines of code long, and 2) you clearly and accurately cite the source of the code you are using in a comment nearby. Explain where you found it (with a URL) and what problem it is solving for you. And for your own sake, make sure you understand it. Some assignments may have more specific rules than these about what collaboration or re-use is allowed.
</li>
          
        
          
            <h2>Changes to Syllabus</h2>
            I reserve the right to alter any part of the syllabus or course schedule at any time. Changes will be announced in class or through email.
          
        
          
            <h2>End-of-Syllabus Advice</h2>
            
Come to office hours. Previous students say coming to office hours helped them with the hard parts of learning how to program. If something in class or in the book isn't clear, the one-on-one interaction with an instructor or TA is often the best way to work it out. Office hours are an important extension of the class sessions, which won't always be sufficient by themselves. In general, the more we interact, and not just in the classroom, the better the semester will be.
